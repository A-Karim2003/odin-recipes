    <h2>What is Lasagne</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It is usually rectangular or ribbon <br> shaped,
       thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. <br>
       After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that <br> 
       varies based on different local traditions. </p>

    <h3>Steps for making lasagne</h3>
    <ol>
<li>Make the béchamel sauce first. In a large saucepan, combine the milk, onion, bay leaves,<br>
    and cloves and bring to a gentle boil. Turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 1 hour.</li>

    <li>In a separate big pot, combine the oil, celery, onion, carrot, garlic, and pancetta for <br>
        the meat sauce. Cook until the vegetables are tender but not browned. </li>
    
    <li>Combine the beef and milk and chopped tomatoes in a mixing bowl. Using a wooden spoon, combine <br>
        the ingredients and break up and crush the mince lumps against the pan's sides. Stir in all of <br>
        the herbs, stock cubes until the mince is mostly broken down, and bring to a boil. Cook for 1 hour, <br>
        stirring occasionally to prevent the bottom from catching.</li>
    
    <li>Uncover and continue to gently boil for 30 minutes to an hour, or until the meat is cooked and the <br>
        sauce is thick. Seasoning and flavour</li>
   
    <li>Pour the milk through a fine sieve into one or two jugs to complete the béchamel sauce. Melt the <br>
        butter in the same pan, then stir in the flour with a wooden spoon and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
    
    <li>Stir in the filtered milk a bit at a time and the mixture will thicken to a doughy paste at first,<br>
        but keep going, adding milk gradually to prevent lumps. Bring to a slow simmer, stirring regularly <br>
        (if you have lumps, give it a quick whisk). Gently bubble for a few minutes, or until thickened. <br>
        Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste. </li>
    
    <li>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius/160 degrees Celsius fan/gas 4. Spread a tablespoon of the <br>
        beef sauce onto the bottom of a 3.5-litre baking dish. Cover with a single layer of dry pasta sheets,<br>
        snapping them together to fit if necessary, and top with a quarter of the béchamel. Spread a third of <br>
        the meat sauce on top, followed by a sprinkle of parmesan.</li>
    
    <li>To utilise all of the meat sauce, repeat the layers of pasta, béchamel, meat, and parmesan two more times. <br>
        Finish with a final layer of spaghetti, the leftover béchamel, and the parmesan. Place the dish on a baking <br>
        pan to collect spillage and bake for 1 hour, or until the top is bubbling, golden, and crisp. </li>
