            <h2 class="sub-title">What is Lasagne</h2>
            <p>Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It is usually rectangular or ribbon
                shaped,thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local
                variants.
                After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that
                varies based on different local traditions.

            <h3 class="sub-title">Steps for making lasagne</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the béchamel sauce first. In a large saucepan, combine the milk, onion, bay leaves,
                    and cloves and bring to a gentle boil. Turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 1 hour.</li>

                <li>In a separate big pot, combine the oil, celery, onion, carrot, garlic, and pancetta for
                    the meat sauce. Cook until the vegetables are tender but not browned. </li>

                <li>Combine the beef and milk and chopped tomatoes in a mixing bowl. Using a wooden spoon, combine
                    the ingredients and break up and crush the mince lumps against the pan's sides. Stir in all of
                    the herbs, stock cubes until the mince is mostly broken down, and bring to a boil. Cook for 1 hour,
                    stirring occasionally to prevent the bottom from catching.</li>

                <li>Uncover and continue to gently boil for 30 minutes to an hour, or until the meat is cooked and the
                    sauce is thick. Seasoning and flavour</li>

                <li>Pour the milk through a fine sieve into one or two jugs to complete the béchamel sauce. Melt the
                    butter in the same pan, then stir in the flour with a wooden spoon and cook for 2 minutes.</li>

                <li>Stir in the filtered milk a bit at a time and the mixture will thicken to a doughy paste at
                    first, but keep going, adding milk gradually to prevent lumps. Bring to a slow simmer, stirring
                    regularly (if you have lumps, give it a quick whisk). Gently bubble for a few minutes, or until
                    thickened.
                    Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste. </li>

                <li>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius/160 degrees Celsius fan/gas 4. Spread a tablespoon of the
                    beef sauce onto the bottom of a 3.5-litre baking dish. Cover with a single layer of dry pasta
                    sheets,snapping them together to fit if necessary, and top with a quarter of the béchamel. Spread a
                    third
                    of the meat sauce on top, followed by a sprinkle of parmesan.
                </li>

                <li>To utilise all of the meat sauce, repeat the layers of pasta, béchamel, meat, and parmesan two more
                    times. Finish with a final layer of spaghetti, the leftover béchamel, and the parmesan. Place the
                    dish on a
                    baking pan to collect spillage and bake for 1 hour, or until the top is bubbling, golden, and crisp.
                </li>
